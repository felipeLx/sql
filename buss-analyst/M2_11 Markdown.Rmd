# Section 1
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

Will this be a new paragraph?

Here is some code within text: ```read.csv('jan17Items.csv')``` It won't really be run, though.

Here is an equation: $NetTotal = \beta_0 + \beta_{1} Quantity + \epsilon$

```{r}
data('mtcars')
head(cars)
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r}
ji <- read.csv('jan17Items.csv', sep = ',', header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
summary(ji)
hist(ji$TotalDue)
hist(log(ji$TotalDue))
plot(ji$Quantity, ji$TotalDue)
plot(ji[,c('Quantity', 'TotalDue', 'Price')])
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
