An extension to the ORDER BY clause called OFFSET-FETCH enables you to return only a range of the rows selected by your query. 

If you want to return rows a "page" at a time (using whatever number you choose for a page), you'll need to consider that each query with an OFFSET-FETCH clause runs independently of any other queries. There's no server-side state maintained, and you'll need to track your position through a result set via client-side code.

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC 
OFFSET 0 ROWS --Skip zero rows
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY; --Get the next 10

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, ListPrice
FROM Production.Product
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC 
OFFSET 10 ROWS --Skip 10 rows
FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY; --Get the next 10

In the syntax definition you can see the OFFSET clause is required, but the FETCH clause is not. If the FETCH clause is omitted, all rows following OFFSET will be returned. You'll also find that the keywords ROW and ROWS are interchangeable, as are FIRST and NEXT, which enables a more natural syntax.
