unit 5: remove duplicates

By default, the SELECT clause includes an implicit ALL keyword that results in this behavior:
SELECT ALL City, CountryRegion
FROM Production.Supplier
ORDER BY CountryRegion, City;

T-SQL also supports an alternative the DISTINCT keyword:
SELECT DISTINCT City, CountryRegion
FROM Production.Supplier
ORDER BY CountryRegion, City;
