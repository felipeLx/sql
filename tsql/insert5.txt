MERGE data based on multiple tables

# MERGE modifies data, based on one or more conditions:

# When the source data has a matching row in the target table, it can update data in the target table.
# When the source data has no match in the target, it can insert data into the target table.
# When the target data has no match in the source, it can delete the target data.

MERGE INTO schema_name.table_name AS TargetTbl
USING (SELECT <select_list>) AS SourceTbl
ON (TargetTbl.col1 = SourceTbl.col1)
WHEN MATCHED THEN 
   UPDATE SET TargetTbl.col2 = SourceTbl.col2
WHEN NOT MATCHED [BY TARGET] THEN
   INSERT (<column_list>)
   VALUES (<value_list>)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
   DELETE;

# WHEN MATCHED and WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses to update or insert invoice data as required.
MERGE INTO Sales.Invoice as i
USING Sales.InvoiceStaging as s
ON i.SalesOrderID = s.SalesOrderID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET i.CustomerID = s.CustomerID,
                i.OrderDate = GETDATE(),
                i.PurchaseOrderNumber = s.PurchaseOrderNumber,
                i.TotalDue = s.TotalDue
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (SalesOrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, PurchaseOrderNumber, TotalDue)
    VALUES (s.SalesOrderID, s.CustomerID, s.OrderDate, s.PurchaseOrderNumber, s.TotalDue);
