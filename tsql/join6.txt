join 6: self joins

SELECT emp.FirstName AS Employee, 
       mgr.FirstName AS Manager
FROM HR.Employee AS emp
LEFT OUTER JOIN HR.Employee AS mgr
  ON emp.ManagerID = mgr.EmployeeID;

# The results of this query include a row for each employee with the name of their manager. 

# To accomplish tasks like this, you should consider the following guidelines:

# Define two instances of the same table in the FROM clause, and join them as needed, using inner or outer joins.
# Use table aliases to differentiate the two instances of the same table.
# Use the ON clause to provide a filter comparing columns of one instance of the table with columns from the other instance of the table.
