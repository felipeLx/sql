join 5: cross joins

# While this result isn't typically a desired output, there are a few practical applications for writing an explicit CROSS JOIN:

# Creating a table of numbers, with a row for each possible value in a range.
# Generating large volumes of data for testing. When cross joined to itself, a table with as few as 100 rows can readily generate 10,000 output rows with little work from you.

# There is no matching of rows performed, and so no ON clause is used.

SELECT emp.FirstName, prd.Name
FROM HR.Employee AS emp
CROSS JOIN Production.Product AS prd;
