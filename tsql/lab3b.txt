# Challenge
# Retrieve products whose list price is higher than the average unit price.
# Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is higher than the average unit price for all products that have been sold.

# Challenge 2: Analyze profitability
# The standard cost of a product and the unit price at which it is sold determine its profitability. You must use correlated subqueries to compare the cost and average selling price for each product.

# Retrieve the product ID, name, cost, and list price for each product along with the average unit price for which that product has been sold.
