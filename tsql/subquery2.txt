subquery2: self-contained or correlated subqueries

# considerations when using correlated subqueries:

# Correlated subqueries cannot be executed separately from the outer query. This restriction complicates testing and debugging.
# Unlike self-contained subqueries, which are processed once, correlated subqueries will run multiple times. Logically, the outer query runs first, and for each row returned, the inner query is processed.
